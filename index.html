                            <p>
                                Houston, Texas, has a rich and diverse history, 
                                shaped by its strategic location, economic growth, and cultural influences.
                                
                                Houston was founded on August 30, 1836, by brothers Augustus and John Kirby Allen on land near the Buffalo Bayou. 
                                The city was named after Sam Houston, the commander of the Texian army during the Texas Revolution, 
                                who led the decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto,
                                    securing Texas' independence from Mexico.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Houston began to diversify its economy with the development of industries such as oil, 
                                shipping, and manufacturing. The discovery of oil at Spindletop near Beaumont
                                    in 1901 marked the beginning of the Texas oil boom, 
                                which transformed Houston into a major energy hub. 
                                Houston's role as a center of space exploration was solidified with the 
                                establishment of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in 1963, 
                                leading to the city’s iconic association with the U.S. space program.
                                
                                Today, Houston is one of the most populous cities in the U.S. and one of the most diverse, 
                                with a strong global presence in industries like energy, space exploration, medicine, and technology. 
                                It's also known for its cultural institutions, including museums, theaters, and a lively culinary scene.

                                The city's history is marked by both periods of rapid growth and challenging times, 
                                but its resilience and adaptability have made it a key economic and cultural hub in Texas and the broader U.S.
